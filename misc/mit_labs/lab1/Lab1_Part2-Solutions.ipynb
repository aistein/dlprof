    "If you want to go further, here are some suggestions for improvements you can make to the model. *Please be advised that these are entirely optional and staff will only be helping with the lab portion of the assignment.*\n",
    "1. **Use a different dataset.** If pop songs aren't your thing, or you want to try training on something else, all you need to do is replace the midi files located in your `/data` folder.\n",
    "2. **Restrict the model output.** You may notice that even if you trained your model for a long time, the model still outputs really high/low notes from time to time. What's happening here is that although the probabilities of these notes appearing are very low, they are not 0 and therefore are still occassionally sampled by the model. To fix this, you could resample the probabilities to only be from notes close to the previous note, or keep sampling until you get a note close to the previous note. \n",
    "3. **Augment the dataset.** Maybe you don't think the dataset we've given you has enough songs, or that the genre of dataset you want to use is too small. An easy way to augment the dataset is by transposing the values in `batch_x` and `batch_y` such that they are randomly shifted up or down by the same amount, resulting in a different pitch. This helps you train a more robust model that can better learn how our perception of music is time dependent and space invariant. In other words, it depends more on the notes' relative position to each other rather than the pitch of the song as a whole. \n",
    "4. **Tune hyperparameters.** As we discussed in today's lectures, the hyperparameters used for training, such as the learning rate, number of hidden units, and the type of RNN cell used, can make a significant impact on the output. Try playing around with hyperparameters to see if you can improve the results. \n",
    "5. **Different optimizers.** In Lecture we learned that different optimizers can make a huge difference in converging to a nice solution during training. Try some different ones that Tensorflow has to offer and see what works best. \n",
    "5. **[advanced] Support polyphonic music.** If you look at the `make_one_hot_notes` function in `create_dataset.py`, you can see that indeed we chose to only take the melody from each song (assumed to be the highest played note at each time step). If you want to go beyond playing one note at a time, you can make changes to how the songs are encoded into matrices, along with how the model is structured to train and generate. A common task in deep learning with music is training a model on Bach chorales and getting it to understand the notion of chords in music. \n",

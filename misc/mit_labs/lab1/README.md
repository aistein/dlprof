## Part 1: Intro to TensorFlow
TensorFlow is a software library extensively used in machine learning. Here we'll learn how computations are represented and how to define simple neural networks in TensorFlow. In this section you will learn the basic of Tensorflow computational graphs, Sessions, and the new imperitive version of Tensorflow: [Eager](https://research.googleblog.com/2017/10/eager-execution-imperative-define-by.html).

## Part 2: Music Generation with RNNs
In this portion of the lab, we will play around with building a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for music generation. We will be using the MIDI music toolkit to create a dataset of music files and build a model that captures the long term dependencies in musical notes. Finally, we will sample from this model to generate brand new music that has never been heard before!
